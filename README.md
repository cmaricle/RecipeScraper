# RecipeScraper
hacky web scraper to get recipes from minimalist baker

You need to download selenium in order to run

Try `./setup.sh` which works on linux to install dependencies

After that's set up, just use 

`python3 scraper.py [ingredient|meal type|etc]`

There is probs bugs bc I made this in 30 minutes lol srry
